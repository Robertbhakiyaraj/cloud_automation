## Generate PSH Schema DDL

The PSH schema DDL can be generated by running the [generatepshschema](../templates/job-generatepshschema.yml) Kubernetes job.

Update [values.yaml](../values.yaml) as follows:

```
generateschema:
  runjob: true
```

Run Harness pipeline to execute the job and initialize the database.

Verify the job logs.

Schema files will be written to the NFS shared defined for this tenant environment.

Update [values.yaml](../values.yaml) again to disable this job.

There is no need to run the Harness pipeline again.
